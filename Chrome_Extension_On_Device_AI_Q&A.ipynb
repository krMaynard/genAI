        "**In an era of information overload, a new Chrome extension leverages the power of Google's built-in Large Language Model (LLM) to provide concise answers to your questions about the content of any webpage. This tool, built with standard web technologies, offers a glimpse into the future of AI-powered browsing, where understanding complex information is just a query away.**\n",
        "\n",
        "This new extension adds a simple interface to your Chrome browser. With the click of a button, you can pose a question about the current page, and the on-device AI will analyze the text and provide a relevant answer. This functionality is made possible by the recently introduced `chrome.ai` API, which grants developers access to Google's Gemini Nano model directly within the browser.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How it Works: A Look Under the Hood\n",
        "\n",
        "The extension is comprised of a few key components that work in tandem to deliver its question-answering capabilities:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Manifest File (`manifest.json`):** This file serves as the blueprint for the extension, defining its name, version, permissions, and the various scripts it utilizes. Crucially, it requests the `activeTab` permission to access the content of the current page and the `scripting` permission to inject code.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Popup Interface (`popup.html` and `popup.js`):** When you click on the extension's icon, a small popup window appears. This is the primary user interface, containing a text area for your question and a button to submit it. The accompanying JavaScript file (`popup.js`) handles the user interaction, capturing the question and initiating the process of retrieving the page content and querying the LLM.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Content Script (`content.js`):** This script is the bridge between the extension and the webpage. It is programmatically injected into the active tab when the user asks a question. Its primary role is to extract the main readable content of the page, stripping away unnecessary elements like navigation bars, advertisements, and footers. To achieve this, the extension utilizes Mozilla's Readability.js library, a robust open-source tool designed for this very purpose.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Background Script (`background.js`):** The background script acts as the central coordinator. It listens for messages from the popup, containing the user's question and the extracted page content. Upon receiving this information, it checks for the availability of the `chrome.ai` API. If the API is accessible, it constructs a carefully worded prompt, combining the page's text with the user's query, and sends it to the built-in LLM for processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Power of On-Device AI\n",
        "\n",
        "A key advantage of this extension is its use of an on-device LLM. This means that all the processing happens locally on your machine, ensuring privacy and a snappy user experience without the need to send data to a server. The `chrome.ai.createGenericSession()` method is used to initiate a session with the LLM, and the `prompt()` method sends the combined text and question for analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "The extension also incorporates error handling to gracefully manage situations where the LLM might not be available. This could be due to the user's Chrome version not supporting the API or the necessary experimental flags not being enabled. In such cases, the user is notified that the feature is unavailable.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Prompt Engineering for Better Answers\n",
        "\n",
        "The quality of the answers provided by the LLM heavily depends on the quality of the prompt. The extension employs basic prompt engineering techniques to guide the model towards providing the most relevant and accurate response. The prompt is structured to clearly delineate the context (the webpage content) and the specific question being asked.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Building Your Own Page-Aware Assistant\n",
        "\n",
        "This Chrome extension serves as a practical example of how developers can start building with the built-in AI capabilities of modern browsers. By combining content extraction libraries like Readability.js with the power of on-device LLMs, the possibilities for creating intelligent and privacy-preserving browser enhancements are vast.\n",
        "\n",
        "For those interested in building a similar extension, the core steps involve:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Setting up the basic Chrome extension structure:** This includes creating the `manifest.json`, `popup.html`, and the necessary JavaScript files.\n",
        "2.  **Integrating a content extraction library:** Mozilla's Readability.js is a strong choice and can be included as a bundled script.\n",
        "3.  **Utilizing the `chrome.ai` API:** Check for its availability and use it to process the extracted content and user queries.\n",
        "4.  **Designing a user-friendly interface:** A simple and intuitive popup is often the most effective approach for this type of interaction.\n",
        "5.  **Implementing robust error handling:** Ensure the extension provides clear feedback to the user if the AI functionality is not available.\n",
